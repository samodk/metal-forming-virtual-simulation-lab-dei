Here we can visualise the reciprocating nature of the upper die which itself is connected with links like piston and ram, moving in an upward and downward direction repeatedly at a constant acceleration which is none other than the gravity pull of the earth. The rollers are placed in order to guide the long moving shaft connecting ram  to move with the to and fro motion easily without being buckled. The billet is placed in the die cavity of the lower die that remains stationary. 
Here in this process the energy required for the deformation of the billet i.e. the strain energy is been supplied by the kinetic energy of the moving hammer which itself gets that energy due its potential energy, by making the hammer to fall from the certain height. The effect of such a tremendous force will be that, the billet will tend to deform rapidly with the decrease of its height and subsequent increase in its cross-sectional area at each stroke of the ram. The process is repeated till the desired shape is obtained.

In the left side of the screen we can see the various components of the knuckle joint press, the components include the driving rotating shaft connected with link 1 (shown in the red colour), which is connected to another fully movable link 2 (shown in the green colour), and this link is connected to 3<sup>rd</sup> link (shown in the yellow colour) which is fixed at one of its end, this link is further connected with the 4<sup>th</sup> and final link (which is shown in the blue colour) whose another end is connected to the ram (also acting as a link) whose vertical motion is guided by the cylinder walls. 
In the right side of the screen we can see that how the kinematics of these inter-connected links look like while in motion. As the link number 1 is moved by the rotating shaft the link 2, link 3, and link 4 are also follow the motion within their prescribed path of motion as constrained by their linkage state. The link4 (blue one) gives the motion to the ram link which is moved to and fro into the cylinder and its motion is been guided by the cylinder walls. This type of forging technique is quite faster as comparison to other techniques in producing the components but with the drawback that it could not apply that much of the pressing force as compared to others.

The rotating motion of the big flywheel is been transmitted to the reciprocating motion of the ram/slide by connecting in between them the connecting rod. The ram moves to and fro in the vertical direction inside the boundaries of the frame with the workpiece kept at the bottom of the frame and at the top of the table which is been compressed and deformed with each successive blows of the mechanical press slowly and gradually, up until it takes the required shape and size. Here the work-piece is reduced in its height whereas gets increased in its cross-sectional area. The force available for deforming work-piece depends upon the stroke position and becomes extremely large at the bottom-dead-centre position; thus, proper setup is essential to avoid breaking the dies or other equipment.

The screw presses derive their energy from a flywheel. The forging load is transmitted through a vertical screw. These presses are energy limited and can be used for many forging operations. They are particularly suitable for producing small quantities, for parts requiring precision (such as turbine blades), and for control of ram speed. In the given video we can see that the two sections of the screen, with left one section depicting the various components of the screw press whereas the right one depicting the working of the screw press. In the left side of the screen we can see the components like the driving wheel, the driven flywheel, the screwed shaft connected to the flywheel, the screwed stationary housing connected with the main cylinder and finally the ram connected with the screwed shaft in the centre of the screen. 
The right side of the screen shows the kinematics of this process in action i.e. the downward stroke of the ram taking place. As the driving wheel is rotated by the subsequent power drive, the flywheel too gets rotated with its axis perpendicular to the axis of the driving wheel through the action of the frictional force acting in between the wheels in contact. The flywheel not only rotates about its axis but also translates up and down within the driving wheel limits. This action is possible due to the screw type of linkage between the externally threaded shaft connected to the flywheel and the internally threaded stationary housing mounted within cylinder grooves. This motion is been transmitted to the ram which is responsible for deforming the kept work-piece over the table by compressing it till it attains the required shape and size.

Cold extrusion is the general term often used to denote a combination of processes, such as direct and indirect extrusion and forging. Many materials can be extruded into various configurations, with the billet either at the room temperature or at the temperature of a few hundred degrees. Extrusion process can be defined as the metal forming process which is used to form the product with the fix cross sectional profile. A material is punched onto the die of the desired cross section. In the given video we can see the two sections of the screen, in the left side we can see the various components involved in extrusion process which includes the moving punch, work-piece and the lower fixed die and in the right side we can see the movement of the punch within the lower die cavity.

Extrusion process can be defined as the metal forming process which is used to form the product with the fix cross sectional profile. A material is punched onto the die of the desired cross section. Extrusion process can be divided into two categories: direct extrusion and indirect extrusion.  Indirect extrusion can also be termed as backward or reversed extrusion. In case of indirect extrusion a die placed in hollow stem moves in relationship with the hollow container, however there is no such relative displacement between container and the billet. The indirect extrusion process is marked by the absence of friction between the container and the billet. In the given video there is  friction of various parts of indirect extrusion process and its working model. In the left side figure there is die, punch or ram assembly. 
The die contain the passage for the movement of hot billet and punch under very high pressure. There are two punches placed inside the die. First punch is placed at the top and is movable in nature, while the other punch is placed at the bottom and is static in nature. It prevents the movement of hot billet towards the downward direction . The upper punch moves downward and compresses the billet. The billet is forced to move out between the gap between the punch and the die in opposite direction to the motion of the die as shown in the figure. In the right hand side one can see the working model of the extrusion process . The hot billet is fixed at the chamber at the top after filling the punch presses the workpiece with very high pressure. As a result the billet is forced to flow out plastically between the gaps between the upper die and the die opposite to the direction of motion of the punch.

In direct extrusion process, we use the forward extrusion process in which the ram is connected with the mandrel. The mandrel is the object which is used to shape the internal cavity of the final product formed through metal forming process. In this extrusion process we see that the workpiece moves along with the mandrel or the ram such that relative velocity between the deformed workpiece and the mandrel is zero finally until the required shape is produced. In the left side of the screen we can see that the various components of the direct extrusion process with the mandrel, the components includes the ram connected with mandrel, the container acting as guide to the ram motion, the workpiece which is to be deformed and the final shaped workpiece. The right side of the screen shows the working of such process. 
Here  the ram connected with mandrel moves to and fro in the vertical direction all along the length of the container up until the final point of its stroke in the container. As the mandrel touches the workpiece in its axial point the workpiece starts to deform all along its length making the material to elongate longitudinally whereas it reduces in its cross-section, with its grains becoming smaller and smaller and also linearly arranged along its length thus increasing its longitudinal strength.

Direct extrusion, also known as forward extrusion, is the most common extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container with the container liners present. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel the entire length of the container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.
In the following video we can see that in the left side of the screen there are various components involved in the extrusion process which includes the pressing stem meant for forcing the dummy block against the work-piece, the initial work-piece before deformation, the cylinder walls protected with the cylinder liner inside them, the lower die block to shape up the cross section of the final extruded component, the die back up to prevent movement of the lower die. The right side of the screen shows the working of this technique. As the pressing stem is moved in downward direction the dummy block compresses the work-piece and force it move out from the smaller orifice of the lower die block with continuous and uniform force. Due to the sudden change in the cross section of the work-piece the forces acting on the lower die is higher, so it is needed to be backed up with the another block. The final component produced will be of shorter and axi-symmetric cross-section.

Because the hydrostatic pressure increases the ductility of the material, brittle materials can be extruded successfully through this method. Hydrostatic extrusion is generally carried out at the room temperature, typically using vegetable oils as the fluid, particularly castor oil because it is a good lubricant and its viscosity is not influenced significantly by the pressure. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to contain the hydrostatic medium. 
In the following video we can see that in the left side of the screen there are various components involved in the hydrostatic extrusion process which includes the working fluid which is been pressed by some piston of the press, this fluid pressurises the pressing stem meant for forcing the punch against the work-piece in the cylinder of smaller cross sectional area where the initial work-piece (i.e. the aluminium bar) is kept with the outer diameter equal to the internal diameter of the cylinder bore in that section, the pressing tool to shape up the cross section of the final extruded component. The right side of the screen shows the working of this technique. As the pressing stem is been moved by the hydraulic pressure action which is been applied by the pressurized fluid, it moves in the downward direction as shown here in the video, the pressing stem with the punch forces the work-piece all along the set bore diameter of the pressing tool, thus decreasing its cross-sectional area to good extent with application of the uniform force all along the punch travel throughout its length of the stroke.

In the hydrostatic extrusion process the billet is completely surrounded by a pressurized liquid, except where the billet contacts the die. This process can be done hot, warm, or cold, however the temperature is limited by the stability of the fluid used. The pressure in the chamber transmits some of the fluid to the die surfaces, thus significantly reducing friction and forces. Because the hydrostatic pressure increases the ductility of the material, brittle materials can be extruded successfully through this method. Hydrostatic extrusion is generally carried out at the room temperature , typically using vegetable oils as the fluid, particularly castor oil because it is a good lubricant and its viscosity is not influenced significantly by the pressure. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to contain the hydrostatic medium. The fluid can be pressurized two ways:<br/>
1.	Constant-rate extrusion: A ram or plunger is used to pressurize the fluid inside the container.<br/>
2.	Constant-pressure extrusion: A pump is used, possibly with a pressure intensifier, to pressurize the fluid, which is then pumped to the container.<br/>
In the following video we can see that in the left side of the screen there are various components involved in the hydrostatic extrusion process which includes the pressing stem meant for forcing the upper die block against the work-piece, the initial work-piece before deformation, the cylinder containing the working fluid with the seals all along its boundary to prevent the leakage of the fluid, the lower die block to shape up the cross section of the final extruded component, the die back up to prevent movement of the lower die. The right side of the screen shows the working of this technique. As the pressing stem is moved in downward direction the liquid in the chamber gets compressed and pressurised hence it enables the work-piece to get compressed all along its exposed surface and forces it to pass through the lower die orifice with continuous and uniform force.

Here one can see the hollow ram or die forces against the stationary work-piece which has been backed up the flat end of the upper die.

This operation is marked by no relative displacement between the containing die and the billet, so we see there is no friction involved between them, which greatly improves the external surface finish of the finished product. Because the billet moves with the container the frictional forces are eliminated. This leads to the following advantages:
<br/>1. A 25 to 30% reduction of friction, which allows for extruding larger billets, increasing speed, and an increased ability to extrude smaller cross-sections.
<br/>2. There is less of a tendency for extrusions to crack because there is no heat formed from friction.<br/>
3. The container liner will last longer due to less wear.<br/>
4. The billet is used more uniformly so extrusion defects and coarse grained peripherals zones are less likely.<br/>
However, one has to remove the lower hollow die that has been pierced upwards into the billet regarding extrusion of the part which sometimes gets stuck to the billet part due to certain plastic deformation, also making this process discontinuous. One cannot be able to obtain the longer continuous extruded part with this technique because one is suppose need to design the hollow die of good strength to bear any such bending regarding  its lengthier size that is to be pressed upwards all the way into the cavity of the container.
